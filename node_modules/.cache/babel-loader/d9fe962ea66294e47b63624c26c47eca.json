We saw a gap in the\r\n      market and jumped at the opportunity. After researching what was needed,\r\n      we have proudly created ‘Hap’, an app that will hopefully make your event\r\n      experience more enjoyable.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Hap allows the attendees of events to communicate with speakers and hosts\r\n      of the event. Giving the opportunity for hosts to clear up any queries\r\n      that attendees may have going into an event, after an event, or even\r\n      during the event.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      We have given the attendees all the information they need in one place!\r\n      The event page is a one stop shop, with all the information that is needed\r\n      including dates, locations, and event descriptions. We have broken this\r\n      down into a simple and intuitive app that works carefree. Anyone is able\r\n      to enjoy Hap.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      Whether you are looking to go to an event and find your crowd, or create\r\n      an event of your own, we have made the app for you!\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hap, It’s where it’s at.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <a>\r\n    <router-link to=\"/register\">\r\n      <button class=\"button--primary\">Join Us!</button>\r\n    </router-link>\r\n  </a>\r\n  <div class=\"ContactUs\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"title--profile\">Contact</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"contactPara\">\r\n      For any futher information or inquires, get in-touch with our team at\r\n      <a href=\"mailto:admin@hap.com\">admin@hap.com</a>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"ContactUs\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"title--profile\">Contact the developers</h2>\r\n    <table class=\"contactTable\">\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Person</th>\r\n        <th>Email</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Justina Ho</td>\r\n        <td>\r\n          <a href=\"mailto:270191422@yoobeestudent.ac.nz\"\r\n            >270191422@yoobeestudent.ac.nz</a\r\n          >\r\n        </td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Keegan Dufty</td>\r\n        <td>\r\n          <a href=\"mailto:270184437@yoobeestudent.ac.nz \"\r\n            >270184437@yoobeestudent.ac.nz</a\r\n          >\r\n        </td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Thomas King</td>\r\n        <td>\r\n          <a href=\"mailto:270033944@yoobeestudent.ac.nz \"\r\n            >270033944@yoobeestudent.ac.nz\r\n          </a>\r\n        </td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </table>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n/*All style files are entered into the 'style.scss' file and converted into css into the 'style.css' file*/\r\n@import \"../assets/styles/style.css\";\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport aboutCoverImage from \"../assets/images/AboutPage.jpg\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      aboutCoverImage,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
