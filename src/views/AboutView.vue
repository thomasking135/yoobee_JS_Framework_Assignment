  <p class="firstParagraphBuffer">Hap was created in 2022 by an event management company to allow event
  attendees and event hosts to have a better experience. We saw a gap in the
  market and jumped at the opportunity. After researching what was needed,
  we have proudly created ‘Hap’, an app that will hopefully make your event
  experience more enjoyable.
<br></p>
<br>
<br>

<p>
  Hap allows the attendees of events to communicate with speakers and hosts
  of the event. Giving the opportunity for hosts to clear up any queries
  that attendees may have going into an event, after an event, or even
  during the event.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
  We have given the attendees all the information they need in one place!
  The event page is a one stop shop, with all the information that is needed
  including dates, locations, and event descriptions. We have broken this
  down into a simple and intuitive app that works carefree. Anyone is able
  to enjoy Hap.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
  Whether you are looking to go to an event and find your crowd, or create
  an event of your own, we have made the app for you!

<p>Hap, It’s where it’s at.</p>
