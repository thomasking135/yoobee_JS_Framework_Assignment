- What problem does it (intend to) solve? The app was created as a sharing app solution does not exist and speakers are unable to connect with their audiences.
- What is the purpose of your project? The purpose of the app is to allow guest anbd speakers to share information about events

## Setup

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

The project requires AXIOS to serve as an API. The NPM is needed along with Mongo DB to access data.

## Usage

How does one go about using it?
If you do not have an account what you will need to click the “sign up” button on our login page. This will ask you for a username and an email address. If you are a returning Hap user, you will be required to enter your Hap username and email.

Once successfully entered a username and email address, press the “login” button and this will direct you to the landing page. Here you will be able to search for all events that you may want to attend or are interested in learning more about. All you need to do to start searching for these events are type your keyword related to the event into the search bar and click the search button. This will search all of our events that have been created and display any events that relate to your keyword.

Along the top of your screen you will see a navigation bar. This bar can take you wherever you need to go on the app. The “Hap” logo and the icon which is a little house will take you back to the home/landing page. The icon next to this which is a circle with a plus in it is where you will go to create your own event. To the left of this is an i in a circle, this will take you to Haps about page, and the final icon will take you to our profile page.

After clicking the plus icon and landing on the create event page you will be able to make your own event for other users to attend. Here you will be required to enter some details in, the app will ask you for the event name, event start and end dates, the privacy of the event, and the location. All of these details will be listed for potential users to see whether the event is appropriate for them. Edit/delete??

Once clicking on the i icon you will be taken to Haps about page. Here is where you can read up about Hap and how we came about. This is also where you will find the Hap contact details if you have any further questions that aren’t answered on this page!

The user profile page is where you will be able to customise your own details! This is where your user name will be able to show, you will also be able to add a profile photo and description on this page. To add a profile photo you will just need to click the grey square and you will be able to add your image in to the app. To add a bio all your will need to do is write your bio in the bio form field, and press submit.
