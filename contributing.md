## General Information
- The app was created by Justina Ho, Keegan Dufty and Thomas King. We are 3 young and eager web designers and developers studying WUX at Yoobee Colleges.
- What problem does it (intend to) solve? The app was created as a sharing app solution does not exist and speakers are unable to connect with their audiences.
- What is the purpose of your project? The purpose of the app is to allow guest anbd speakers to share information about events
- Why did you undertake it? We undertook the project as we believed we could create an environment that would benefit the parties mentioned previously.

## Setup
What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

The project requires AXIOS to serve as an API. The NPM is needed along with Axios to access data. 


## Usage
How does one go about using it?
One goes to the login page (/login). After entering their details (user: user, password: user) the user arrives on the home page. They can select a post to read it or choose to create a new post to add an event to the list.
