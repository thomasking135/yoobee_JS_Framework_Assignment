## General Information
- The app was created by Justina Ho, Keegan Dufty and Thomas King. We are 3 young and eager web designers and developers studying WUX at Yoobee Colleges.
- What problem does it (intend to) solve? The app was created as a sharing app solution does not exist and speakers are unable to connect with their audiences.
- What is the purpose of your project? The purpose of the app is to allow guest anbd speakers to share information about events
- Why did you undertake it? We undertook the project as we believed we could create an environment that would benefit the parties mentioned previously.

## Setup
What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?
This project is created using Vue JS 3
This requires the Vue CLI and Vue router to be installed to use.

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

The project requires AXIOS to serve as an API. The NPM is needed along with Axios to access data.
To access the *DB* the user will also need to install the following packages:
- npm install json-server
- npx json-server --watch data/db.json 


## Usage
How does one go about using it?
One goes to the login page (/login). After entering their details (user: user, password: user) the user arrives on the home page. They can select a post to read it or choose to create a new post to add an event to the list.

## Project Status
Project is: 
The project is on track for completion. We aim to have the MVP ready for submission by 6pm on Sunday the 25th of September. 


## Room for Improvement
There are many areas where this app could be improved.

Room for improvement:
- The ability for users to have more effective filtering options in the search area
- The ability to login using a social network login
- Users could have the ability to have avatars that appear across the website and people can engage more directly between members
- The ability to have a profile area where users could customse their settings (i.e. dark mode, changing font size and colour, background colour etc)

Here is a list of TODO features we would like to integrate in the future. 
To do:
- The ability for the users to upload images and videos
- The ability to chat interactively with other Hap app users
- The integration of a follow button to allow users to send friend requests and to connect with other users
- Improved search bar functionality
- Integrations to more effectively improve and enable private communication and the pushing of notifications
- Creating an open functioning forum
- Improving the the performance and delivery of real time notifications
- Improving the customizable privacy settings and security of the ap app
